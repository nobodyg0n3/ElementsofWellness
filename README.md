Before:
1. Activate on optitrack cameras via Motive software.
2. Turn on floor projectors.
3. Open motive and ensure all rigid bodies are activated as expected (should be
labeled with their object type).
4. Open Unity.
5. Before building and running, ensure that all elements are correctly calibrated.
Eleents often needed a new calibration in terms of angle (even though it is
dampened on motive) and within the emissions module (predominantly the X
position) for each particle.
a. This can be done by just clicking on “play” and seeing that everything
displays in a fluid manner on screen).

Water
1. Pick up the rock. Two axis on top and one centered towards the bottom typically
is best for optitrack to read it at different angles.
2. Walk with the object in hand.
3. River will flow behind user when motion is identified.

Sand
1. Pick up the salt shaker with and hold it with the grinder facing the bottom.
2. Shake the salt shaker and watch sand slowly descend unto ground.

3. Note: Angles do not change. However, XY changes.
Wind
1. Pick up fan.
2. Fan can be rotated from base to showcase the movement of the dust storm or
change the direction of wind. Furthermore, one can move around the screen.
3. Important Notes:
a. Make sure you go slow if flipping, since it can get a bit clustered when
moving directions.
b. Before testing wind sand interaction, ENSURE that the direction of the
wind will not push it down.
